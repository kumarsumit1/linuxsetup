# Conky Rings Working Theme

Copied from https://github.com/psycho-valker/Conky-Rings-Improved 
#TODO will work on it

Hi,

The whole setup is based on Conky Revamped theme by trollpunny on www.devianart.com. However, some modification are already available in the web but i made some changes in the code working fine on arch linux with kde plasma 5 as a desktop environment.

There are four separate Conky widgets in the whole setup:
	- the main one with rings
	- memory
	- CPU
	- notes (lists the contents of file "~/notes.txt")
	
Use the startconky.sh script to start them in proper order.

Put all the files in ~/.Conky/ and run the script to start them. You can autostart the script at startup to make it
load at every boot.

Enjoy, experiment, share your results!

My enhancements to the original theme:
	
	- Made it look even more minimal.
	- Removed Error of black Background of conky widgets.
	- Corected some references to BAT1 to fetch baterry information.
	- Reduced the size of clock hands.
	- Removed minute and hour rings to make it look less cluttered.
	- Changed the Conky window settings to make the background transparent.
	- Fixed the repeated "conky: unknown variable" error in the console upon execution of the script
	- A few more minor changes in font and positioning that I probably will remember after I've uploaded it. :D
